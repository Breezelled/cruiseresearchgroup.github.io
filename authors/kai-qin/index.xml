      <title>Behaviour Analytics of Indoor Occupants to Personalise Activity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project will deploy machine learning to human behaviour and building operational data obtained through Activity Based Working (ABW), aimed at providing insights towards optimising and personalising ABW. The outcome is a cloud-based integrated platform, with tailored ABW apps, for capturing and analysing occupancy behaviour and building performance data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rich model of workers’ movements, online activities, and social groupings will be learned from synthesising fine-grained ABW behaviours and space utilisation patterns. The web dashboard will be used by Arup to approach their work holistically, making decisions based on a clear view of the total outcomes for their clients and stakeholders, including value for money. It allows Arup to close the design feedback loop, through a deeper understanding of the impact of the engineered parameters of modern offices on ABW and building operations, enhancing the precision with which Arup prescribe solutions on multiple client contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Swarming: Micro-flight Data Capture and Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the urgent need for more site specific and vertical environmental information to inform the design of sustainable urban design, this project investigates the use of Micro Air Vehicles (drones) equipped with diverse lightweight sensing equipment to gather site specific environmental sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multidisciplinary team of researchers from RMIT, with Aurecon, one of the world’s leading engineering, design, planning, project management and consulting company and Australian unmanned aerial vehicle specialist UAV-Australia, are proposing to research, for the first time the usage of emerging micro flight technology to gather and analyse large volume of heterogeneous sensor data, over extended time periods and locations, with the aim to inform urban design and planning, and integrate them for urban design and urban computing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep Learning for Situation Awareness in Airport Operations</title>
      <link>https://kaiqinchi.github.io/project/deep_learning_for-situation-awareness/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:42:51 +1100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kaiqinchi.github.io/project/deep_learning_for-situation-awareness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project that is funded by Northrop Grumman Corporation investigates the patterns of ground vehicles and aircraft trajectories, combining the analysis of their spatial movement behaviours and contextual information. We utilise state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and big data analytics techniques to clean, preprocess, and analyse sizeable on-ground aircraft GPS data. We also establish a context-aware system to predict the delay time of each aircraft by developing a novel Airport Traffic Complexity (ATC) model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome leads to multiple economic and security benefits for airline passengers, air traffic controllers, and airport managers. Our work provides a situational awareness map to the airport traffic controller, which reveals the potential factors that affect the traffic flow at the airport, as well as points out the hot spots and anomalous cases. Additionally, our proposed solution could inform airport managers and traffic controllers regarding the estimated delay time of flights on the tarmac at the specific airport.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monington Peninsula Smart Parking and Amenities for High Demand Areas</title>
      <link>https://kaiqinchi.github.io/project/monington_peninsula_smart_parking/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:42:51 +1100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kaiqinchi.github.io/project/monington_peninsula_smart_parking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mornington Peninsula Shire (MPS) will develop a Smart Technology project to address growing demand on parking and amenity facilities in towns particularly with high tourist
attraction. There is an increasing pressure to understand the volume of pedestrians, public transport users, and road users (in particular, private vehicle drivers) throughout the major townships in MPS and meet the increasing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to model future scenarios will provide a basis to plan infrastructure, provide better routing recommendations, and to assist the planning of events throughout the Shire. Latest smart technology has been sourced along with high-level expertise to develop the necessary systems to gather and translate data into productive outcomes to provide better services to the community and tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The targeted parking and amenities in the high demand towns have varying operations that need specific sensor types to provide the required data. Consequently, the sensors will
require the development and implementation of a tailored system to gather the data and provide information for the community, visitors, Council service teams and planners.&lt;/p&gt;
