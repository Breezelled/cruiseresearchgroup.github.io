This growing number of sensor-based time-series applications require new approaches in data mining, knowledge discovery, and ubiquitous computing.\nWe proposed a general framework for multivariate time series forecasting, called evolutionary model construction (EMC), to jointly select the informative channels of the factors, to extract the valuable features from the selected channels applied to the optimal-configured model, and to improve prediction accuracy[5,6].\nWhen dealing with high-dimensional time-series from mobile, wearable, and Internet of Things streamed from the field, the data is often noisy and unlabelled. We perform unsupervised and self-supervised multivariate time-series pre-processing approaches such as segmentation and change point detection problems to extract the most homogeneous segments in the absence of ground truth labels.\nTo solve multidimensional time-series segmentation, we have proposed an unsupervised approach, IGTS (Information Gain-based Temporal Segmentation)[1,2], a technique to find the transition times in human activities and daily routines[3], from heterogeneous sensor data. Further, ESPRESSO [4] (Entropy and ShaPe awaRe time-series SegmentatiOn), a general multivariate segmentation method, is proposed as an improvement to IGTS, specifically to cover a broader range of inputs by combining statistical (entropy) and shape-based features of time-series.\n[1] Sadri, A., Ren, Y. and Salim, F.D., 2017.
