The collision pattern mining, detection, and warning framework managed to issue collision warning 3-4 seconds earlier than the baseline mathematical models, which was significant in the area of collision avoidance, and could make the difference between life and death in real-world situations. This work was cited multiple times by the same group of researchers from UC Berkeley’s Intelligent Transportation Systems and Robotics department and Mercedes Benz R\u0026amp;D centre, who followed the idea from Dr. Salim’s papers further to develop their own risk assessment at road intersections. The work was also cited by autonomous vehicle researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), signal processing researchers from University of Washington, and a mobile network researcher from National Cheng Kung University who developed his own collision warning apparatus which was patented in 2016.
